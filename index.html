        <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Nakayu. I am currently a student at Weber State University and am in my second semester back at college after a 5 year break from school. My current goal is to get my associates degree and if everything goes according to plan, I will have my associates in general studies by December. I have always been interested in STEM and I have found a great interest in computer science and am looking into pursuing that as my career path.</p>

        <p>A little bit more about me, I have been married to my wonderful husband for almost seven years. I have three wonderful kids and am a mom to a special needs little boy who has autism. With being a full time student and a mom to three young kids I am certainly busy. I do love spending time with my family and in warmer weather we like to spend a lot of time at the park. In my free time I love to read or watch a good murder mystery, and look up cheesy math and science jokes and share them with my husband.</p>
